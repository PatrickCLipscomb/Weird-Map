#  Weird Map

The Portland Weird Map is a geographical display of "weird" locations around Oregon's biggest city. In addition to typical features present in Google Maps API applications (zooming, scrolling, street, and satellite views), the Portland Weird Map allows users to interact with how data points are displayed with category filtering. The ability to route a weird crawl between 2 and 8 locations is also available to the user. A list of locations is displayed by category and can be added to the route map by checking their individual boxes. Lastly, the map contains a Data Map that shows a color coded cluster map of bars in Multnomah County by neighborhood.
